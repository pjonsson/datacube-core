Datasets
========
Datasets are a fundamental part of the Open Data Cube. A dataset is *“The smallest aggregation of data independently described, inventoried, and managed.”​* (Definition of “Granule” from NASA EarthData Unified Metadata Model​)

Dataset metadata format
=======================

For a detailed description of the format of a valid dataset document, refer to the
`formal specification`_ in the eo3 github repository.

Ingested Datasets
=================

Previous releases distinguished between ``indexed`` and ``ingested`` datasets.  In datacube 1.9,
support for the ``ingestion`` workflow has been dropped, and all datasets can be considered
``indexed``.
