Products
=============================

Products are collections of ``datasets`` that share the same set of measurements and some subset of metadata.


Product Definition
******************

A product definition document describes the measurements and common metadata
for a collection of datasets.

.. note::

   "Products" were historically originally known as "Dataset types" and you may see this terminology lingering
   in some places in documentation or the code base.
