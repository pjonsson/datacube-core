Dataset Documents
*****************

Dataset metadata documents define critical metadata about a dataset including:

   - available data measurements
   - platform and sensor names
   - geospatial extents and projection
   - acquisition time
   - provenance information

Traditionally the :ref:`dataset-metadata-doc-eo` format was used to capture
information about individual datasets. However there are a number of issues with
this format, so it is now deprecated and we recommend everyone move to using
the :ref:`dataset-metadata-doc-eo3`.  The legacy eo format is not supported by
the ``postgis`` index driver.  Support for the eo format will be dropped in
Datacube 2.0

The format is determined by the Open Data Cube using the ``$schema`` field in the document.
Include an eo3 ``$schema`` for eo3 documents. If no schema field exists, it
is treated as the older ``eo`` format.

EO3 Format
==========

EO3 is the current internal format for the Open Data Cube. Design goals included:

#. Avoid duplication of spatial information, by storing only native projection information
#. Capture geo-registration information per band, not per entire dataset
#. Capture image size/resolution per band
#. Lightweight lineage representation


.. code-block:: yaml

   # UUID of the dataset
   id: f884df9b-4458-47fd-a9d2-1a52a2db8a1a
   $schema: 'https://schemas.opendatacube.org/dataset'

   # Product name
   product:
     name: landsat8_example_product

   # Native CRS, assumed to be the same across all bands
   crs: "epsg:32660"

   # Optional GeoJSON object in the units of native CRS.
   # Defines a polygon such that all valid pixels across all bands
   # are inside this polygon.

     type: Polygon

          transform: [30, 0, 618285, 0, -30, -1642485, 0, 0, 1]

   # Per band storage information and references into `grids`
   # Bands using the "default" grid should not need to reference it
   measurements:
      pan:               # Band using non-default "pan" grid
        grid: "pan"      # should match the name used in `grids` mapping above

Elements ``shape`` and ``transform`` can be obtained from the output of ``rio
info <image-file>``. ``shape`` is basically ``height, width`` tuple and
``transform`` capturing a linear mapping from pixel space to projected space
encoded in a row-major order.

For a full description of the eo3 dataset metadata format, refer to the
eo3 `formal specification`_.



A command-line tool to validate eo3 documents called ``eo3-validate`` is available
in the `eodatasets3 library <https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/eo-datasets>`_,
as well as optional tools to write these files more easily.

A command-line tool also exists for dynamically converting STAC items to EO3 datasets
at indexing time in the `odc-apps-dc-tools`_ package.

.. code-block::

   # transform [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, 0, 0, 1]

   [X]   [a0, a1, a2] [ Pixel]
   [Y] = [a3, a4, a5] [ Line ]
   [1]   [ 0,  0,  1] [  1   ]

3D dataset metadata
-------------------

3D loading can be achieved through ``odc-loader`` package.

#. Install odc-loader, e.g. ``pip install odc-loader``
#. Add a ``driver="rio",` argument to ``dc.load()``

Time-stacked NetCDF files
-------------------------

It is possible to add NetCDF files with multiple time slices to the Open Data Cube index.
The time slice index can be specified by adding a fragment `#part=<int>` to the `path` of a band starting from 0.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   measurements:
      time_stacked_netcdf_example:
        path: file://some.nc#part=0
        layer: some_var
